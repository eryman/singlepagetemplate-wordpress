# Single Page Bootstrap Template

## Using the Single Page Bootstrap Template

This is a template for a single page WordPress theme created with Bootstrap featuring a scrolling nav and a separate blog page. Best used for business pages and personal portfolio/CV pages.

To use, copy the entire singlepagetemplate file into the 'themes' folder on your server. Once this is done, go to your /wp-admin/, go to Appearance -> Themes and choose "Single Page Theme."

Use the variables at the top of the style.scss file to change fonts and color schemes.
